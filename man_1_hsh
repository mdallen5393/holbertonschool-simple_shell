.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a simple implementation of a command language interpreter that executes
commands read from standard input or a specified file.
.Sh OPERANDS
The following operands are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It command_string
Used to specify the executable or program to attempt to run, along with any variables for use in the function.
.El
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return,
.Nm
returns 0.
Upon error, a different value is returned corresponding to the status of the program.

This implementation of
.Nm
is incomplete.  Certain common commands (such as 'cd') are not supported.
.Pp
Semicolons, pipes, redirections, and other advanced features are not currently
supported.
.Pp
Executables that cannot be found cause segmentation faults.
.Pp There is a known small memory leak.
.Sh EXAMPLES

.Pp
# echo "ls" | ./hsh
.Pp
file1.c  file2.c file3.c file4.c
.It To exit, use the builtin exit.
